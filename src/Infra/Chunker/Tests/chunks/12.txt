South African Administration

Following Germany's defeat in World War I, the League of Nations mandated South Africa to administer the territory.
South Africa imposed its apartheid policies, further marginalizing the indigenous peoples and intensifying the struggle
for independence. Despite international condemnation, South African control persisted, leading to decades of resistance
and conflict.
