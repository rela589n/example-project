Biodiversity and Ecosystem Health

The preservation of trees is also critical for maintaining the biodiversity necessary for medicinal plant research.
Studies have shown that old-growth forests, with their dense canopy cover, are rich in medicinal plant diversity,
providing habitats for numerous species that could hold the key to future medical breakthroughs. Deforestation and
habitat destruction threaten these ecosystems, potentially leading to the loss of invaluable plant species before their
medicinal properties can be explored.
