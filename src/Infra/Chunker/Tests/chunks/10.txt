Pre-Colonial Era

The earliest inhabitants of Namibia were the San and Khoe peoples, who lived as nomadic hunters and gatherers for
thousands of years. These indigenous groups managed the land's limited resources and developed a rich cultural heritage.
Over time, Bantu-speaking groups such as the Owambo, Herero, and Kavango migrated into the region, establishing
agricultural and pastoral societies. The interactions among these groups laid the foundation for Namibia's diverse
cultural landscape.
