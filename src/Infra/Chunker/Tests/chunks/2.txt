 Additionally, trees play a significant role in maintaining
biodiversity. They provide habitat and food for a wide range of species, from insects to birds and mammals. Forests,
which are large expanses of trees, are home to the majority of the world's terrestrial biodiversity. Protecting trees,
therefore, means preserving the habitats of countless species, some of which are endangered.
