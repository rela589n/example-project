Social and Health Benefits

On a social level, trees contribute to the well-being of communities. They enhance the beauty of landscapes and provide
spaces for recreation and relaxation. Studies have shown that green spaces with abundant trees can reduce stress,
improve mood, and promote physical activity, all of which contribute to better mental and physical health.
