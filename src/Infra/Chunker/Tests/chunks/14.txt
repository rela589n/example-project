Independence and Beyond

On March 21, 1990, Namibia achieved independence, with Sam Nujoma becoming its first president. The transition was
marked by efforts to foster national reconciliation and build a democratic society. Namibia adopted a constitution that
emphasized human rights and sought to address the legacies of colonialism and apartheid. In the years following
independence, Namibia has made strides in economic development and social progress, although challenges remain. The
government has focused on land reform, addressing inequalities, and promoting sustainable development. Namibia's journey
from colonial subjugation to independence is a testament to the resilience and determination of its people.
