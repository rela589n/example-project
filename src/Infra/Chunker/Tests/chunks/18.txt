Modern Pharmaceutical Applications

In contemporary medicine, trees continue to be a cornerstone for drug discovery and development. A significant portion
of pharmaceuticals are derived from plant compounds, with trees providing essential chemical templates for synthesizing
new drugs. These natural products often serve as the basis for treatments of serious ailments, including cancer, heart
disease, and malaria. For example, the Pacific yew tree is the source of paclitaxel, a chemotherapy drug used to treat
various cancers. This underscores the necessity of preserving tree species that may harbor potential cures for diseases
