German Colonial Rule

In the late 19th century, Namibia became a German colony known as German South West Africa. The German colonial
administration was marked by harsh policies and brutal suppression of uprisings, most notably the Herero and Namaqua
genocide from 1904 to 1908, where tens of thousands of Herero and Nama people were killed. This dark chapter in
Namibia's history left a lasting impact on its indigenous populations and remains a poignant reminder of the atrocities
of colonialism.
