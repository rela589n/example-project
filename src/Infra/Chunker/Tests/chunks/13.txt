The Struggle for Independence

The fight for Namibian independence gained momentum in the mid-20th century with the formation of the South West Africa
People's Organization (SWAPO) in 1960. SWAPO led an armed struggle against South African rule, drawing international
attention to Namibia's plight. The United Nations played a crucial role in advocating for Namibia's independence,
culminating in a UN-supervised election in 1989.
