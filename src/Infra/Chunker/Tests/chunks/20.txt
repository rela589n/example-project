Socioeconomic and Cultural Importance

Beyond their direct medicinal applications, trees support traditional medicine practices that are vital to the
healthcare systems of many indigenous and rural communities. In regions where access to modern pharmaceuticals is
limited, trees offer an accessible and affordable source of treatment, often forming the backbone of local healthcare.
Protecting these natural resources ensures that communities can continue to rely on traditional knowledge and practices
that have been passed down through generations.
