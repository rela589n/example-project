Historical Significance of Medicinal Trees

Historically, trees have been integral to traditional medicine systems across the globe. Ancient cultures, such as those
in China, India, and Egypt, have long utilized tree-derived substances for healing purposes. For instance, the bark of
the willow tree, which contains salicylic acid, has been used for centuries to alleviate pain and inflammation,
eventually leading to the development of aspirin, one of the most widely used drugs today. Similarly, the opium poppy,
another plant-based source, has given rise to powerful painkillers like morphine and codeine, highlighting the
long-standing relationship between trees and medicinal advancements.
