Economic Importance

Trees also have substantial economic value. They contribute to the economy by providing raw materials for various
industries, including timber, paper, and pharmaceuticals. Sustainable forestry practices ensure that these resources are
available for future generations without depleting the forests. Furthermore, trees enhance property values and attract
tourism, which can be a significant source of income for many communities.
